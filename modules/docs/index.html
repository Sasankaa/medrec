<h1>Oracle WebLogic Server Samples Overview</h1>

<p>The WebLogic Server examples help you to learn about Java EE, Spring, and developing applications on Oracle WebLogic Server. They consist of API examples and two Avitek Medical Records sample applications, which are described in more detail below.</p>

<h1>Java EE 7 Code Examples</h1>
<p>Oracle WebLogic Server now fully supports the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) 7 specification. The Java EE 7 examples demonstrate how to implement new Java EE 7 APIs and Oracle WebLogic Server-specific features.  If you are new to Oracle WebLogic Server, or new to Java EE 7 programming, these examples provide simple, functional code samples to help you get started with new Java EE 7 features in WebLogic Server. See the <a href="javascript:reloadTOC('../examples/src/examples/examples.html')">Oracle WebLogic Server Examples Guide</a> for more information. </p>

<h1>Java EE 6 Code Examples </h1>
<p>These code examples demonstrate Java EE 6 features.  If you are new to Oracle WebLogic Server, or new to Java EE programming, these examples provide simple, functional code samples to help you get started with the Java EE 6 features in WebLogic Server. See the <a href="javascript:reloadTOC('../examples/src/examples/examples.html')">Oracle WebLogic Server Examples Guide</a> for more information. </p>

<h1>Managed Coherence Servers Examples</h1>
<p>Managed Coherence Servers provides tight integration between WebLogic Server and Coherence.  This integration allows for a simplified and streamlined development and management environments of distributed applications. The examples cover various scenarios using Managed Coherence Servers so that you can easily get started in building and deploying Coherence applications. Some of the examples also cover how various Coherence features can be easily used from inside Managed Coherence Servers. See <a href="javascript:reloadTOC('../examples/src/examples/coherence/index.html')">Managed Coherence Servers Examples</a> for more information.</p>

<h1>Additional Code Examples  </h1>
<p>The Oracle WebLogic Server API examples demonstrate how to implement various Java EE APIs and Oracle WebLogic Server-specific features. If you are new to Oracle WebLogic Server, or even new to Java EE programming, the Oracle WebLogic Server API examples provide simple, functional code samples to help you get started. See the <a href="javascript:reloadTOC('../examples/src/examples/examples.html')">Oracle WebLogic Server Examples Guide</a> for more information. </p>

<h1>Avitek Medical Records</h1>
<p> Avitek Medical Records (or MedRec) is a comprehensive sample application that demonstrates how to use Oracle WebLogic Server and Java EE features together in a real-world Java EE application suite. In addition to providing extensive code examples for developing Java EE applications, Avitek Medical records helps you to understand the Oracle WebLogic Server development environment and how to use that environment to build your own applications and modules, using one of the following environment categories: 
<ul>
<li>Default single server domain</li>
<li>Multi-tenant SaaS domain running three partitions on a single server</li>
<li>Multi-tenant SaaS Sample running three partitions on a Coherence cluster</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are already familiar with Oracle WebLogic Server or basic Java EE programming, or if you are interested in using  Oracle WebLogic Server development tools, start with the Avitek Medical Records application and documentation.</p> 
<p>To see <a href="javascript:reloadTOC('../medrec/docs/introduction.html')">Avitek Medical Records Sample Application</a> related documentation, simply configure the <code>medrec</code> domain and MedrecServer, then refer to Avitek Medical Records Sample Application Overview and Getting Started with MedRec for more information.</p>

<h1>Avitek Medical Records (Spring Version)</h1>
<p>The Spring version of Avitek Medical Records is based on the original MedRec, but it is re-implemented using the Spring framework. The Spring version is an Oracle WebLogic Server sample application suite that concisely demonstrates many aspects of Spring and WebLogic Server. MedRec Spring is designed as an educational tool for all levels of Spring/WebLogic Server developers. It showcases the use of each Spring component and illustrates best-practice design patterns for component interaction and client development. MedRec Spring also illustrates best practices for developing and deploying applications to Oracle WebLogic Server.</p>
<p>To see <a href="javascript:reloadTOC('../medrec-spring/docs/introduction.html')">Avitek Medical Records (Spring) Sample Application</a> related documentation, simply configure the <code>medrec-spring</code> domain and MedrecServer (Spring version), then refer to Avitek Medical Records (Spring) Sample Application Overview and Getting Started with MedRec (Spring) for more information.</p>
