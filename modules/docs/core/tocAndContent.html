<!-- Changed JW 10/4/03: Originally, the TOC frame pointed to toc.html (now toc-frame.html).
The only purpose of toc.html was to call top.displayTOC(). This added
complexity because I had to prevent toc.html from being added to the browser
history list when top.displayTOC() overwrote it.

top.displayTOC() cannot be called from this page, because a <script> element
isn't allowed after a <frameset> element, and if I put the <script> element
in the <head> element, then displayTOC() doesn't know what the "myToc" frame
is because that frame hasn't been declared yet.

I solved this by calling top.displayTOC() in content.html.
