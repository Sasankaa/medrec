<!-- The purpose of this file is simply to call the reDisplay() function
when the user changes the bookmark list (by adding, deleting, etc).
The reason this gets its own file is so that I can load it using
javascript's replace() function, which prevents old states of the
bookmark list from being added to the browser history list. We never want
to display an outdated bookmark list.
